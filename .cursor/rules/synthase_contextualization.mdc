Rule Name: synthase_contextualization
Description: 
When working in the synthase directory, follow this contextualization process to understand the codebase before making changes:

1. KEY FILES TO EXAMINE:
   - Command Implementation: Start with index.ts, then utils.ts, display.ts, and organization.ts in src/commands/fibers/
   - Configuration System: Understand loader.ts, discovery.ts, and validator.ts
   - Project Standards: Review CHANGELOG.md for documentation patterns

2. UNDERSTANDING PRIORITY:
   - First build structural understanding of command flow
   - Then examine data processing in utils and organization
   - Finally understand presentation logic in display modules

3. CONFIGURATION HIERARCHY:
   - Module metadata (from direct inspection) has highest priority
   - Fiber-specific config.yaml files are checked next
   - Global user configuration is the fallback

4. TESTING APPROACH:
   - Run example commands with --detailed flags
   - Compare actual vs. expected behavior
   - Trace issues through the call chain

5. KEY CONCEPTS:
   - Fibers: Top-level organizational units (core, dotfiles, etc.)
   - Chains: Individual modules associated with fibers
   - Dependencies: Relationships between fibers and chains
   - Tree visualization: Shows dependency relationships with proper indicators

Always maintain these conventions:
- Special handling for 'core' (always first) and 'dotfiles' fibers
- Document all changes in CHANGELOG.md with proper formatting
- Use established visual indicators (ðŸŸ¢/ðŸ”´) consistently
- Keep clear separation between discovery, organization, and display concerns
