# Synthase Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Synthase TypeScript port of Chitin.

## Implementation Rounds

The implementation will proceed in multiple rounds, with each round producing a complete and working set of changes that can be tested before moving to the next round.

### Round 1: Project Setup and Configuration System
1. Set up the TypeScript project structure
2. Implement configuration loading system

### Round 2: Module System Implementation
1. Implement module discovery and loading
2. Create module dependency resolution

### Round 3: Tool Management
1. Implement tool discovery and validation
2. Create tool installation system

### Round 4: Shell Integration and CLI
1. Implement shell script execution
2. Create environment variable management

### Round 5: Performance Optimization and Final Polish
1. Implement caching systems
2. Optimize resource usage

## Collaboration Approach

To improve collaboration throughout the implementation:

1. Each round will produce a complete and working set of changes for testing
2. Testing will occur between rounds before continuing to the next phase
3. Regular feedback will be incorporated into subsequent rounds
4. Progress will be tracked to maintain visibility
5. Documentation will be kept current with implementation
