# Synthase Round 2 Implementation Task

## Documentation to Review
1. **Review all documentation** in both `docs/` and `process/` directories
2. **Pay special attention to**:
   - `process/round1-implementation.md` to understand what was completed in Round 1
   - `process/round1-changelog.md` to see the actual changes implemented in Round 1
   - `process/round2-implementation.md` for detailed Round 2 plan
   - `docs/initialization.md` for module system design
   - `docs/shell-integration-mechanisms.md` for how modules interact with the shell

## Key Requirements
- Implement module discovery and loading system
- Create module dependency resolution
- Develop module validation against configuration
- Implement fiber-based module filtering
- Connect modules to the configuration system from Round 1
- Build module state tracking and persistence

## Structure
Follow the directory structure in `process/round2-implementation.md` exactly.

## Technology
- Continue using Bun and TypeScript from Round 1
- Build on the configuration system implemented in Round 1
- Implement necessary data structures for dependency resolution (graphs, topological sorting)

## Deliverables
1. Working module discovery system
2. Module dependency resolution with circular dependency detection
3. Module validation against configuration
4. Fiber integration for module filtering
5. Module state tracking and persistence
6. Comprehensive test suite for all new functionality

We'll review your implementation before proceeding to Round 3.
