# Synthase Development Principles

This document outlines the core principles and philosophies guiding Synthase development. These principles should be followed by all contributors to maintain a consistent, high-quality product experience.

## Product-First Mentality

- **Complete Product Presentation**: Always treat and present Synthase as a complete, professional product - not as a work-in-progress or port.

- **No Implementation Details**: Never expose implementation stages, rounds, or technical porting processes in user-facing elements.

- **Future-Neutral Language**: Avoid phrases like "will be implemented in the future" or references to development phases in UI, documentation, or error messages.

- **Polish Over Progress**: Focus on making existing functionality polished and professional rather than exposing partial implementations of future features.

## User-Centric Perspective

- **Benefits Over Implementation**: Describe features in terms of user benefits ("Group related tools into logical modules") rather than implementation details ("Uses a hierarchical YAML structure").

- **Problem-Solution Framing**: Frame capabilities in terms of the problems they solve for users, not the technical approaches used.

- **User Journey Focus**: Consider how users interact with and experience the software, not just how it functions technically.

- **Accessible Language**: Use terminology familiar to the target audience rather than implementation-specific jargon.

## Professional Software Standards

- **Consistent Abstraction**: Maintain consistent abstraction levels when describing features and capabilities.

- **Purposeful Interface Design**: Design CLI output, messages, and interfaces with user needs in mind (e.g., placing commands on their own line for easy copying).

- **Complete Experience**: Ensure error messages, help text, and documentation create a cohesive, professional experience.

- **Distinction From Development**: Keep a clear separation between development artifacts (implementation plans, rounds) and the product itself.

These principles aim to create a professional, user-focused product that appears complete and purposeful rather than revealing its development process. By following these guidelines, we maintain a consistent, high-quality experience for all users and establish Synthase as a polished, professional tool.
