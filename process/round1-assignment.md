# Synthase Round 1 Implementation Task

## Documentation to Review
1. **Read all documentation** in both `docs/` and `process/` directories to gain complete context
2. **Pay special attention to**:
   - `docs/configuration-system-details.md` for configuration system
   - `process/spec.md` for overall project specification
   - `process/implementation-plan.md` for our iterative approach
   - `process/round1-implementation.md` for detailed Round 1 plan

## Key Requirements
- Set up TypeScript project using Bun runtime
- Implement configuration loading system for YAML files
- Create Bash-TypeScript interface for environment variables
- Build initial CLI with config loading command
- Write tests for all components

## Structure
Follow the directory structure in `process/round1-implementation.md` exactly.

## Technology
- Use Bun for runtime, package management, and testing
- TypeScript for all implementation
- js-yaml for YAML processing

## Deliverables
1. Working configuration system compatible with existing files
2. TypeScript type definitions for all configuration objects
3. CLI with load-config command
4. Comprehensive test suite

We'll review your implementation before proceeding to Round 2.
