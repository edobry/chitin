# Task Management Process

When working on any task in the codebase, always follow the process defined in `/process/todos.md`. This includes:

1. Check `/process/todos.md` for existing tasks before starting work
2. Follow the task specification in `/process/tasks/{id}-{name}.md` exactly
3. Complete all verification steps before marking a task complete
4. Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
5. Create a PR referencing the task number
6. Check and respect task dependencies

Tasks are only considered complete when ALL verification steps pass. Never skip verification steps or mark a task complete without meeting all requirements.

The full process documentation is maintained in `/process/rules/todos-process.md`.
