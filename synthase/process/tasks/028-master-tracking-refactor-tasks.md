# Master tracking task for all refactor TODOs

## Overview
This task will track all related refactor and structural improvement tasks, ensuring dependencies are clear and progress is visible.

## Current Issues
- Many related refactor tasks may be missed or duplicated
- Dependencies between tasks may not be clear

## Required Changes
- Create a master task in `/process/todos.md` referencing all sub-tasks
- For each sub-task, note dependencies (e.g., "Refactor tools.ts before updating CLI handlers")
- Mark each as complete as it is merged

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] List all related refactor tasks in this master task
- [ ] Note dependencies between tasks
- [ ] Update progress as tasks are completed

## Verification
- [ ] All related tasks are tracked
- [ ] Dependencies are clear
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated

## Notes
- Keep this task up to date as new refactor tasks are added
