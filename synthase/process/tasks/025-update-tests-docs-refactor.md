# Add/update tests and documentation for refactored modules

## Overview
As modules are refactored, tests and documentation must be updated to ensure reliability and ease of onboarding.

## Current Issues
- Refactored modules may lack adequate tests
- Documentation may be outdated after refactor

## Required Changes
- For each new module, add or update unit tests
- Update or create module-level documentation
- Ensure all public APIs are documented
- Run all tests and ensure coverage is not reduced

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Add/update unit tests for each refactored module
- [ ] Update or create documentation for each module
- [ ] Ensure all public APIs are documented
- [ ] Run all tests and check coverage

## Verification
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage is not reduced
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated

## Notes
- Coordinate with other refactor tasks to avoid conflicts
