# Chitin Project Change Implementation Plan (2025-04-16 11:15:02)

_**User**_

in this session you are going to act as an engineer implementing a planned change to the chitin project, which is documented in the `process` directory. the extant system is documented in the `docs` directory.

you're going to first read all the docs to understand current system state and then very briefly summarize your findings. then you will read the process docs to understand the planned changes, and concisely but comprehensively summarize what we're going to do.

after this, think about how to structure your own process of following the implementation plan. you will structure your work so as to go in multiple rounds, producing a complete and working set of changes after each, which I will then go and test before having you continue to the next round. explicitly account for this in your planning. make sure to think about ways to improve our collaboration and to suggest if there are any important ones

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll help you implement the planned changes to the chitin project. Let's start by understanding the current system and the planned changes.

---

Read file: README.md

---

Now let's examine the documentation to understand the current system:

---

Let's go through the existing documentation to understand the current system:

---

Read file: docs/bash-script-patterns.md

---

Let's continue reviewing the documentation:

---

Read file: docs/initialization.md

---

Let's examine more documentation files:

---

Read file: docs/configuration-system-details.md

---

Now, let's examine the planned changes by looking at the process directory:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory process â€¢ **5** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| ðŸ“„ `implementation.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `spec.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `synthase-readme.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `typescript-structure.md` |

</details>

Let's check the specification and implementation plans:

---

Read file: process/spec.md

---

Read file: process/implementation.md

---

Read file: process/typescript-structure.md

---

Read file: process/synthase-implementation-guide.md

---

Based on my review of the documentation and the implementation plan, let me summarize the current system and the planned changes.

## Current System Summary
Chitin is a modular and extensible shell framework with a hierarchical structure:
- **helpers**: Individual shell functions
- **chains**: Collections of helpers focused on specific domains
- **fibers**: Top-level modules grouping chains by domain

The system uses a configuration hierarchy with user, fiber, and chain-level configurations. It manages tools with automated installation and version checking, and provides dynamic variable management for module state tracking.

The current implementation is in Bash scripts, organized into chains and fibers, with a comprehensive initialization process handling configuration loading, module discovery, and tool management.

## Planned Changes Summary
The project aims to port Chitin to TypeScript, creating a new implementation called "Synthase" (named after the enzyme that catalyzes chitin polymerization in nature). Key aspects include:

1. **Creating a TypeScript Implementation**: Building a Node.js application that maintains the same structure and interactions as the current shell implementation.

2. **Phased Approach**:
   - **Phase 1**: Configuration System - Replace configuration handling
   - **Phase 2**: Module System - Replace module loading
   - **Phase 3**: Tool Management - Replace tool checking and installation
   - **Phase 4**: Shell Integration - Replace shell script execution
   - **Phase 5**: Performance Optimization

3. **Bash-TypeScript Interface**: Providing a smooth transition through three stages:
   - **Coexistence**: Bash remains primary with TypeScript handling specific tasks
   - **Hybrid Operation**: TypeScript handles more components with Bash coordination
   - **Full Migration**: TypeScript becomes primary with Bash as thin wrapper

4. **Project Structure**: Creating a new `synthase` directory with a modern TypeScript package structure following best practices.

## Implementation Process Plan

I'll structure our work in multiple rounds, with each round delivering working changes that you can test:

### Round 1: Project Setup and Configuration System
1. Set up the TypeScript project structure
2. Implement basic types and interfaces
3. Create the configuration loading system
4. Implement the bash-TypeScript interface for configuration
5. Set up testing framework
6. **Deliverable**: Working configuration system that can load and validate configurations

### Round 2: Module System Implementation
1. Implement module discovery and loading
2. Create module dependency resolution
3. Develop module validation
4. Connect modules to configuration system
5. **Deliverable**: Working module system that can discover and load modules

### Round 3: Tool Management
1. Implement tool discovery and validation
2. Create tool installation system
3. Develop version checking
4. Connect tools to module system
5. **Deliverable**: Working tool system that can verify and install tools

### Round 4: Shell Integration and CLI
1. Implement shell script execution
2. Create environment variable management
3. Develop cross-platform support
4. Build the CLI interface
5. **Deliverable**: Complete CLI that can be used as an entry point

### Round 5: Performance Optimization and Final Polish
1. Implement caching systems
2. Develop parallel operations
3. Optimize resource usage
4. Create comprehensive documentation
5. **Deliverable**: Optimized system ready for production use

## Collaboration Improvements
To improve our collaboration, I suggest the following:

1. **Regular Testing Cycles**: After each round, you'll test the implementation and provide feedback.

2. **Progress Tracking**: We'll maintain a checklist of completed features to track progress.

3. **Unit Tests**: I'll create comprehensive tests for each component to ensure reliability.

4. **Documentation**: I'll update documentation as we go to keep it in sync with the implementation.

5. **Quick Prototypes**: For complex features, I'll create quick prototypes for you to evaluate before finalizing.

6. **Incremental Commits**: I'll commit changes incrementally so you can review small, focused changes.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this plan before we start with Round 1?

---

_**User**_

lets persist this plan to a doc in the process dir; do any of the existing docs already cover this, or does it make sense to create a new one?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Let me check if any of the existing documents in the process directory already cover our implementation plan.

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory process â€¢ **5** results</summary>

| ðŸ“„ `implementation.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `spec.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `synthase-readme.md` |
| ðŸ“„ `typescript-structure.md` |

</details>

---

The existing documentation seems to cover the high-level implementation plan ("implementation.md") and various aspects of the project, but none specifically outline our phased implementation approach with the regular testing and feedback loops we just discussed.

I'll create a new document called "implementation-plan.md" that captures our specific approach with the rounds structure and collaboration improvements.

+ # Synthase Implementation Plan with Iterative Testing
+ 
+ This document outlines the concrete implementation plan for Synthase, the TypeScript port of Chitin, with a focus on iterative delivery and regular testing cycles.
+ 
+ ## Overview
+ 
+ The implementation will follow a phased approach with multiple rounds of development. Each round will deliver a complete and working set of changes that can be tested independently before moving to the next round.
+ 
+ ## Implementation Rounds
+ 
+ ### Round 1: Project Setup and Configuration System
+ 1. Set up the TypeScript project structure in `synthase/` directory
+ 2. Implement basic types and interfaces
+ 3. Create the configuration loading system
+ 4. Implement the bash-TypeScript interface for configuration
+ 5. Set up testing framework
+ 
+ **Deliverable**: Working configuration system that can load and validate configurations from existing YAML files.
+ 
+ **Testing Focus**: 
+ - Configuration loading works correctly
+ - User configuration is properly detected
+ - Bash-TypeScript interface functions as expected
+ 
+ ### Round 2: Module System Implementation
+ 1. Implement module discovery and loading
+ 2. Create module dependency resolution
+ 3. Develop module validation

+ 
+ **Deliverable**: Working module system that can discover and load modules from the existing chains directory.
+ 
+ **Testing Focus**:
+ - Modules are correctly discovered
+ - Dependencies are properly resolved
+ - Module state is tracked and accessible
+ 
+ ### Round 3: Tool Management
+ 1. Implement tool discovery and validation
+ 2. Create tool installation system
+ 3. Develop version checking
+ 4. Connect tools to module system
+ 
+ **Deliverable**: Working tool system that can verify and install tools based on module requirements.
+ 
+ **Testing Focus**:
+ - Tool requirements are correctly extracted from modules
+ - Tool verification works as expected
+ - Tool installation functions properly
+ 
+ ### Round 4: Shell Integration and CLI
+ 1. Implement shell script execution
+ 2. Create environment variable management
+ 3. Develop cross-platform support
+ 4. Build the CLI interface
+ 
+ **Deliverable**: Complete CLI that can be used as an entry point for Chitin initialization.
+ 
+ **Testing Focus**:
+ - CLI commands work correctly
+ - Shell scripts are properly executed
+ - Environment variables are correctly managed
+ 
+ ### Round 5: Performance Optimization and Final Polish
+ 1. Implement caching systems
+ 2. Develop parallel operations
+ 3. Optimize resource usage
+ 4. Create comprehensive documentation
+ 
+ **Deliverable**: Optimized system ready for production use.
+ 
+ **Testing Focus**:
+ - Performance is improved compared to baseline
+ - Cache invalidation works correctly
+ - System functions reliably across platforms
+ 
+ ## Collaboration Approach
+ 
+ To maximize effectiveness and ensure quality, the following collaboration practices will be followed:
+ 
+ 1. **Regular Testing Cycles**: After each round, the implementation will be tested and feedback will be provided before proceeding to the next round.
+ 
+ 2. **Progress Tracking**: A checklist of completed features will be maintained to track progress through each round.
+ 
+ 3. **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive tests will be created for each component to ensure reliability and facilitate future changes.
+ 
+ 4. **Documentation**: Documentation will be updated alongside implementation to keep it in sync with the actual code.
+ 
+ 5. **Quick Prototypes**: For complex features, quick prototypes will be created for evaluation before finalizing the implementation.
+ 
+ 6. **Incremental Commits**: Changes will be committed incrementally for easier review and rollback if needed.
+ 
+ ## Integration with Existing System
+ 
+ The implementation will follow the three-phase approach outlined in the specification document:
+ 
+ 1. **Phase 1: Coexistence** (Bash Primary)
+    - Bash (`init.sh`) remains the primary entry point
+    - Synthase is invoked by bash for specific functionality
+    - Environment variables are exchanged between systems
+ 
+ 2. **Phase 2: Hybrid Operation**
+    - Both entry points are supported
+    - Synthase handles configuration, module loading, and tool management
+    - Bash handles script execution and shell integration
+ 
+ 3. **Phase 3: Full Migration**
+    - Synthase becomes the primary recommended entry point
+    - `init.sh` becomes a thin wrapper around Synthase
+    - Both paths provide identical functionality
+ 
+ ## Success Criteria
+ 
+ The implementation will be considered successful when:
+ 
+ 1. All functionality of the current Bash implementation is preserved
+ 2. The TypeScript implementation provides a clean, typed API
+ 3. Performance is maintained or improved
+ 4. Cross-platform support is robust
+ 5. Documentation is comprehensive
+ 6. Testing coverage is adequate 
```

---

I've created a new document called `implementation-plan.md` in the process directory. While the existing `implementation.md` covers the general implementation approach, our new document specifically outlines:

1. The 5 implementation rounds with concrete deliverables for each
2. Testing focus areas for each round
3. Our collaboration approach with regular feedback cycles
4. Integration phases with the existing system
5. Success criteria for the project

This approach gives us a clear roadmap to follow, with specific checkpoints for testing and feedback after each round. This ensures we'll have a working system at each stage rather than waiting until the end to test everything.

The document complements the existing documentation without duplicating it, serving as our practical execution plan with testing milestones.

Looking at the original instructions, I've covered the key elements you mentioned:

1. The rounds-based implementation approach with 5 distinct rounds
2. Each round producing complete, working changes for testing
3. Testing occurring between rounds
4. Collaboration improvements including feedback loops and progress tracking

The document focuses specifically on the implementation process with regular testing cycles, which was the main focus of your original request. It provides a clear structure for how the work will be approached in rounds with testing between each phase.

Is there anything specific from your original instructions that you feel isn't represented in the document?

# Round 1 Implementation Plan: Project Setup and Configuration System

## Design Approach

For Round 1, I'll focus on establishing the TypeScript project structure and implementing the configuration system that can load and parse Chitin's YAML configurations. The design will follow these principles:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separating concerns between configuration loading, validation, and usage
2. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript types representing configuration schemas
3. **Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with existing YAML configuration files
4. **Testability**: Making components easy to test independently

## Directory Structure

I'll create the following directory structure in the `synthase/` folder:

```
synthase/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ loader.ts       # Configuration loading logic
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ validator.ts    # Configuration validation
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ merger.ts       # Configuration merging logic
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts        # Exports configuration functionality
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config.ts       # Configuration type definitions
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts        # Type exports
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file.ts         # File system utilities
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ yaml.ts         # YAML processing utilities
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ path.ts         # Path expansion utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shell/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ environment.ts  # Bash-TypeScript environment interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cli.ts              # Initial CLI implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts            # Main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/             # Config-related tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/              # Utility tests
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Package definition
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ jest.config.js          # Jest configuration
â””â”€â”€ .eslintrc.js            # ESLint configuration
```

## Tools and Runtimes

1. **Runtime**: Node.js (v16+) for its mature ecosystem and cross-platform support
2. **Package Manager**: npm for dependency management
3. **Build System**: TypeScript compiler (tsc) for transpilation
4. **Testing Framework**: Jest for unit and integration testing
5. **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
6. **Formatting**: Prettier for consistent code style

### Core Dependencies
- `typescript` for TypeScript support
- `js-yaml` for YAML parsing and generation
- `commander` for CLI argument parsing
- `chalk` for terminal coloring
- `fs-extra` for enhanced file system operations

### Development Dependencies
- `@types/node` for Node.js type definitions
- `@types/js-yaml` for YAML library types
- `jest` and `ts-jest` for testing
- `eslint` and related plugins for linting
- `prettier` for code formatting

## Type System Design

I'll define the following TypeScript interfaces to represent Chitin's configuration system:

1. **Core Configuration Types**:
   - `UserConfig`
   - `FiberConfig`
   - `ChainConfig`
   - `ToolConfig`

2. **Nested Configuration Types**:
   - `ToolDependency`
   - `ToolInstallMethod`
   - `PresenceCheck`
   - `VersionCheck`

3. **Utility Types**:
   - `ConfigurationMergeOptions`
   - `PathExpansionOptions`
   - `ConfigValidationResult`

## Key Functions and Components

1. **Configuration Loading**:
   - `loadUserConfig()`: Load user configuration
   - `loadModuleConfig()`: Load module configuration
   - `mergeConfigurations()`: Merge configurations with proper precedence

2. **Path Handling**:
   - `expandPath()`: Expand path variables (e.g., `~`, `localshare`)
   - `findConfigPath()`: Find configuration files

3. **YAML Processing**:
   - `parseYaml()`: Parse YAML files
   - `serializeToYaml()`: Convert objects to YAML

4. **Bash Interface**:
   - `importEnvironmentFromBash()`: Read bash environment variables
   - `exportEnvironmentToBash()`: Create sourceable bash file with environment

5. **CLI Commands**:
   - `load-config`: Load and output configuration
   - `init`: Basic initialization (minimal for Round 1)

## Implementation Approach

1. **Project Setup** (Days 1-2):
   - Initialize the TypeScript project
   - Set up the directory structure
   - Configure build and test tools
   - Create initial package.json

2. **Type Definitions** (Days 2-3):
   - Define configuration-related TypeScript interfaces
   - Create utility types
   - Document types with JSDoc comments

3. **Configuration Loading** (Days 3-5):
   - Implement YAML loading and parsing
   - Create path expansion utilities
   - Implement configuration merging logic
   - Add configuration validation

4. **Bash Interface** (Days 5-6):
   - Create environment variable exchange utilities
   - Implement error handling
   - Add sourcing mechanism for bash

5. **CLI Implementation** (Days 6-7):
   - Set up basic CLI structure
   - Implement configuration loading command
   - Create help documentation

6. **Testing** (Throughout):
   - Create unit tests for each component
   - Add integration tests for the configuration system
   - Test against existing configuration files

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test configuration loading with known inputs
   - Test path expansion with various paths
   - Test YAML parsing with valid and invalid files
   - Test bash interface with mock files

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test full configuration loading pipeline
   - Test against actual user config files
   - Test CLI with various arguments

3. **Test Fixtures**:
   - Sample configuration files
   - Mock environment variables
   - Mock file system for consistent testing

## Deliverables

By the end of Round 1, I'll deliver:

1. A fully configured TypeScript project in the `synthase/` directory
2. Working configuration loading system compatible with existing configs
3. Type definitions for configuration objects
4. Bash-TypeScript environment exchange utilities
5. Initial CLI with configuration loading command
6. Comprehensive tests for all components

## Next Steps for Round 2

After completing Round 1, I'll seek feedback on:
1. TypeScript project structure and organization
2. Type definitions and their accuracy
3. Configuration loading performance
4. Bash-TypeScript interface reliability

This feedback will inform the approach for Round 2, which will focus on the module system implementation.

_**User**_

lets use bun instead of node. are you familiar with bun, do you have access to its documentation?

also, i did not ask you for # of day estimates

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'm familiar with Bun as a JavaScript runtime, package manager, and bundler that aims to be a faster alternative to Node.js. While I don't have direct access to its most current documentation, I understand its key features including native TypeScript support, compatibility with npm packages, and generally improved performance.

Let me revise the Round 1 implementation plan to use Bun instead of Node.js and remove the day estimates:

# Round 1 Implementation Plan: Project Setup and Configuration System

## Design Approach

For Round 1, I'll focus on establishing the TypeScript project structure and implementing the configuration system using Bun as the runtime. The design will follow these principles:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separating concerns between configuration loading, validation, and usage
2. **Type Safety**: Strong TypeScript types representing configuration schemas
3. **Compatibility**: Ensuring compatibility with existing YAML configuration files
4. **Testability**: Making components easy to test independently

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shell/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ environment.ts  # Bash-TypeScript environment interface
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ cli.ts              # Initial CLI implementation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts            # Main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/             # Config-related tests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/              # Utility tests
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Package definition
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ bun.lockb               # Bun lockfile
â””â”€â”€ .eslintrc.js            # ESLint configuration
```

## Tools and Runtimes

1. **Runtime**: Bun for improved performance and built-in TypeScript support
2. **Package Manager**: Bun's built-in package manager

   - `UserConfig`
   - `FiberConfig`
   - `ChainConfig`
   - `ToolConfig`

2. **Nested Configuration Types**:
   - `ToolDependency`
   - `ToolInstallMethod`
   - `PresenceCheck`
   - `VersionCheck`

3. **Utility Types**:
   - `ConfigurationMergeOptions`
   - `PathExpansionOptions`
   - `ConfigValidationResult`

## Key Functions and Components

1. **Configuration Loading**:
   - `loadUserConfig()`: Load user configuration
   - `loadModuleConfig()`: Load module configuration
   - `mergeConfigurations()`: Merge configurations with proper precedence

2. **Path Handling**:
   - `expandPath()`: Expand path variables (e.g., `~`, `localshare`)
   - `findConfigPath()`: Find configuration files

3. **YAML Processing**:
   - `parseYaml()`: Parse YAML files
   - `serializeToYaml()`: Convert objects to YAML

4. **Bash Interface**:
   - `importEnvironmentFromBash()`: Read bash environment variables
   - `exportEnvironmentToBash()`: Create sourceable bash file with environment

5. **CLI Commands**:
   - `load-config`: Load and output configuration
   - `init`: Basic initialization (minimal for Round 1)

## Implementation Approach

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Initialize the Bun project
   - Set up the directory structure
   - Configure build and test tools
   - Create initial package.json

2. **Type Definitions**:
   - Define configuration-related TypeScript interfaces
   - Create utility types
   - Document types with JSDoc comments

3. **Configuration Loading**:
   - Implement YAML loading and parsing
   - Create path expansion utilities
   - Implement configuration merging logic
   - Add configuration validation

4. **Bash Interface**:
   - Create environment variable exchange utilities
   - Implement error handling
   - Add sourcing mechanism for bash

5. **CLI Implementation**:
   - Set up basic CLI structure
   - Implement configuration loading command
   - Create help documentation

6. **Testing**:
   - Create unit tests for each component
   - Add integration tests for the configuration system
   - Test against existing configuration files

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test configuration loading with known inputs
   - Test path expansion with various paths
   - Test YAML parsing with valid and invalid files
   - Test bash interface with mock files

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test full configuration loading pipeline
   - Test against actual user config files
   - Test CLI with various arguments

3. **Test Fixtures**:
   - Sample configuration files
   - Mock environment variables
   - Mock file system for consistent testing

## Deliverables

By the end of Round 1, I'll deliver:

1. A fully configured Bun+TypeScript project in the `synthase/` directory
2. Working configuration loading system compatible with existing configs
3. Type definitions for configuration objects
4. Bash-TypeScript environment exchange utilities
5. Initial CLI with configuration loading command
6. Comprehensive tests for all components

## Next Steps for Round 2

After completing Round 1, I'll seek feedback on:
1. Bun+TypeScript project structure and organization
2. Type definitions and their accuracy
3. Configuration loading performance
4. Bash-TypeScript interface reliability

This feedback will inform the approach for Round 2, which will focus on the module system implementation.

# Bun Overview and Benefits for Synthase Implementation

Based on the documentation, Bun offers several advantages for our Synthase implementation:

## Key Bun Features Relevant to Synthase

1. **All-in-one Runtime**: Bun combines a JavaScript/TypeScript runtime, bundler, test runner, and package manager in a single tool, simplifying our development setup.

2. **Native TypeScript Support**: Bun can directly execute TypeScript files without transpilation, which is perfect for our TypeScript implementation of Chitin.

3. **Performance**: Bun is designed for speed, which will be beneficial for our configuration system and eventual shell integration.

4. **Node.js Compatibility**: Bun aims for full Node.js compatibility, ensuring we can use any necessary Node.js modules for backward compatibility.

5. **File System Operations**: Bun provides highly optimized native APIs for file I/O, which will be important for our configuration loading and module discovery.

6. **Testing Framework**: Bun's built-in test runner uses Jest-compatible syntax, making it easy to create comprehensive tests for our implementation.

7. **Shell Scripting**: Bun's cross-platform shell-scripting API (`$` shell) will be extremely useful for our Bash-TypeScript interface.

## Implementation Benefits for Synthase

For Round 1 (Project Setup and Configuration System), Bun offers:

1. **Project Initialization**: Using `bun init` to scaffold our TypeScript project structure quickly.

2. **YAML Processing**: Bun can load and process YAML configuration files efficiently using compatible libraries.

3. **Direct TypeScript Execution**: We can develop and test without a separate build step, accelerating the development cycle.

4. **Environment Variable Handling**: Bun has built-in support for environment variables via `Bun.env`, useful for our configuration system.

5. **File I/O Performance**: Bun's optimized file system API will make configuration loading faster.

6. **Testing**: Bun's built-in test runner can be used to test our configuration loading and validation logic.

7. **Shell Integration**: Bun's shell API can simplify our Bash-TypeScript interface implementation.

## Specific Tools We'll Use

1. **`bun init`**: To initialize our project
2. **`Bun.file()`**: For efficient file operations
3. **`bun test`**: For running our test suite
4. **`bun run`**: For executing scripts
5. **`$` shell API**: For our Bash interface
6. **TypeScript**: Directly supported by Bun

## Migration Considerations for Chitin

Given that Chitin is a shell framework, Bun's shell scripting capabilities and performance characteristics make it a good fit for our TypeScript port. The `$` shell API can help bridge the gap between the Bash implementation and our TypeScript code.

Would you like me to provide more specific examples of how we'll use Bun for particular aspects of the Round 1 implementation?
